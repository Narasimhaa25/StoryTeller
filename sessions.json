Every morning, he woke up with a happy yawn and a wag of his fluffy tail.\n\nOne bright afternoon, as Simba was pouncing through tall green grass, he discovered something wonderful. It was a beautiful, smooth, rainbow-colored pebble! It sparkled and shone in the sunlight. Simba had never seen anything so pretty. He held it carefully in his paw.\n\nSimba felt so happy with his new treasure. He saw his friends, a speedy little cheetah named Cheeto and a playful monkey named Mimi, playing nearby. At first, Simba thought about keeping the special pebble all to himself. But then, a warm feeling bubbled up inside him. He remembered how much fun it was to share happy moments.\n\nHe trotted over to Cheeto and Mimi, holding out the sparkling pebble. \"Look what I found!\" he purred. Cheeto's eyes widened, and Mimi clapped her tiny hands. They took turns holding the rainbow pebble, admiring its beautiful colors. They even imagined it was a tiny, fallen star. Sharing the pebble made Simba feel even happier than finding it. They spent the rest of the afternoon playing and laughing together, their hearts full of joy.\n\nSharing our special treasures makes everyone's day a little brighter."

Its petals were golden, and it smelled sweet. Barnaby wanted to see the very top, but it was just a little too high for him.\n\n\"Oh, if only I could see its happy face!\" he thought.\n\nJust then, a tiny ant named Pip scurried by. Pip was on his way to explore. He also noticed the beautiful sunflower. Pip wanted to see the top too, but from the ground, it looked like a giant, sunny mountain.\n\nBarnaby saw Pip looking up. \"Hello, little friend!\" he whispered. \"Isn't it a lovely flower?\"\n\nPip waved his tiny antennae. \"It is! I wish I could see its sunny smile up close.\"\n\nBarnaby had a gentle idea. He carefully lowered his head. \"Hop on, Pip! I can give you a ride.\"\n\nPip carefully climbed onto Barnaby's long ear. Up, up, up they went! Now Pip was high enough to see the sunflower's bright center. \"Oh, it's wonderful!\" Pip exclaimed. \"It has tiny patterns like a golden maze!\"\n\nBarnaby smiled, feeling happy that Pip could see. Pip then hopped down, full of happy wiggles. \"Thank you, Barnaby! Now I know what a sunflower's smile looks like.\"\n\nBarnaby felt warm inside. They both enjoyed the sunshine and the beautiful flower together.\n\n***\n\nEven small friends can help each other see wonderful new things."
